**Overview**
This project is an assignment for developing a RESTful API for a note-taking application. It includes functionalities for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting notes. MongoDB is used as the database to store notes, and the API is built using Node.js and Express.js.

**Project Structure**
The project follows a basic structure with the main components being:

app.js: Entry point for the application, includes server setup, MongoDB connection, and API endpoint definitions.
models/Note.js: Defines the MongoDB schema for a note.
tests/: Contains basic test cases using Jest to ensure API functionality.
README.md: Documentation for the GitHub repository.

**Getting Started**
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/note-taking-api.git
Install dependencies: npm install
Configure MongoDB Atlas connection in app.js.
Start the server: npm start
Run tests: npm test
API Endpoints
Create Note: POST /notes
Retrieve Notes: GET /notes
Retrieve Single Note: GET /notes/:id
Update Note: PUT /notes/:id
Delete Note: DELETE /notes/:id
For detailed documentation on each endpoint, refer to the API Documentation section.

**Data Validation**
Validation is implemented to ensure that the title and content fields are provided and are of appropriate lengths.

**Error Handling**
Comprehensive error handling is implemented to cover scenarios like invalid input, attempting to access or modify non-existent notes, etc.

**Basic Authentication**
The API is protected by Basic Authentication. Use the following credentials:
Username: admin
Password: Password123

**Documentation**
Detailed documentation for API endpoints, including request methods, URL paths, expected request body format, and response formats, can be found in the API Documentation section.

**Testing**
Basic tests have been implemented using Jest to ensure API endpoints are functioning as expected. Run tests with npm test.
